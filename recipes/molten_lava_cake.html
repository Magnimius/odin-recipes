    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Indulge in the best-kept secret of the dessert world with Claire Saffitz's Molten Lava Cake! In this exciting YouTube video, Claire unveils the truth behind this beloved treat found on menus everywhere. Discover the simplicity of this two-bowl dessert, just a half-step above brownies, that can be ready in under 45 minutes. <br>But here's the twist: Claire's version includes a special ingredient—olive oil. This addition not only enhances the "molten" effect by making the batter more fluid but also creates a delightful flavor combination with chocolate. Don't forget to keep a watchful eye on the cakes while baking, as they can quickly overcook and lose their gooey centers. For the ultimate presentation, serve them immediately.</p>
